# Lists

## What are Lists?
Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
Items are ordered, changeable and allow duplicate values.
Items in a list are accessed with an index number, e.g. first item is accessed with `[0]`
## How to use:

```python
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(thislist)
```
