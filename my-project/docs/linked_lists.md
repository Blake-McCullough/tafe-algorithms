# Linked Lists

## What are linked lists?
A linked list is a sequence of data elements which are connected together by links (Each elements contains a connection to another in the form of a pointer.)

## How to use:

```python
class Node:
   def __init__(self, dataval=None):
      self.dataval = dataval
      self.nextval = None

class SLinkedList:
   def __init__(self):
      self.headval = None

list1 = SLinkedList()
list1.headval = Node("Mon")
e2 = Node("Tue")
e3 = Node("Wed")
# Link first Node to second node
list1.headval.nextval = e2

# Link second Node to third node
e2.nextval = e3
```
